When walking by mirrors, I noticed that people tend to subconsciously stare at the mirrors back to themselves to check their own appearance or to take mirror pictures. However, after I learnt about spy two-way mirrors, I felt more cautious interacting with mirrors due to my paranoia of being spied on. For this project titled “Mirror-Selfie”, I am embodying my fear of being stared back at by the mirror or anything behind the mirror. Using a camera with the OpenCV Python library, I detect faces and print out a frame of the moment when anyone looks into the mirror.",

Although every person has the same 24 hours in a day, the passage of time can feel faster or slower based on activities, environments, and interpersonal interactions. This variability highlights the surreal and fluid nature of time. <br> In philosophy, time is often regarded as a metaphysical concept, defying material definition. The progression of moments—the future becoming the present and the present transitioning into the past—creates a dynamic interplay that can distort our perception of time. In group settings, for example, the flow of conversation and actions can seemingly compress time, reducing the perceived gaps between past, present, and future. <br>This reflection underscores the intangible and abstract nature of time. It extends beyond the numerical representation of hours on a clock, often relying on intuition and perception. This abstraction challenges traditional notions of time, emphasizing its fluid and subjective essence.",
